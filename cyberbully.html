It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior.</p>

                    <P class="lead fs-2">In the quiet town of Doncaster, lived two curious siblings, Joe and Joana. Joe, a vibrant and adventurous 13-year-old, was always the ringleader, while his thoughtful 10-year-old sister Joana followed suit with a smile. Unbeknownst to them, their parents, Hero and Miko, carried a secret as extraordinary as any superhero comic.</P>

                    <img src="assets/images/HeroMiko.jpeg" class="d-block w-100" alt="heromiko">
                    <p class="lead fs-2">Hero and Miko, when the world was asleep, transformed into CyberSafe Guards, protectors of children from digital threats. Their suits, a blend of Ultraman's sleek design from Japan and the iconic shield-wielding Captain America from the USA, glimmered in the night. Armed with shields that could deflect any online harm, they watched over children across the globe.</p>

                  <div class="carousel-item">
                    <img src="assets/images/CyberBully.webp" class="d-block w-100" alt="CyberBully">
                    <p class="lead fs-2">One day, as the family enjoyed a peaceful afternoon in their garden, a sudden shadow cast over them. It was an alien villain from the outer reaches of space—CyberBully. This monstrous being thrived on spreading fear among children through the dark corners of the internet. Its goal was simple: to prey on the innocence of kids, making them doubt themselves and feel utterly alone.</p>

                    <div class="carousel-item">
                        <img src="assets/images/worriedkids1.jpeg" class="d-block w-100" alt="worriedkids1">
                        <p class="lead fs-2">Joe and Joana, oblivious to their parents' secret lives, began to notice strange things happening. Messages from unknown sources appeared on their screens, each one more menacing than the last. Joe, trying to protect his sister, stood firm, but even he felt the creeping fear. Joana, with her wide eyes and hopeful heart, clung to her brother, sensing something far more dangerous at play.</p>

                    <div class="carousel-item">

                        <p class="lead fs-2">What happed to the siblings if choosing not to report the messages or confide in their parents? They began to feel the weight of their silence. Joe's once unshakable resolve started to crack, and he found it harder to concentrate at school. His grades began to slip, and his once vibrant spirit became overshadowed by a constant sense of dread. Joana, too, felt the strain, her cheerful demeanor replaced by anxiety and sleepless nights. The once close-knit bond between the siblings began to fray, as the pressure mounted and the messages grew more sinister. Their well-being, both emotional and academic, was caught in a downward spiral, threatening to engulf them completely.</p>

                        <p class="lead fs-2">Hero and Miko knew it was time to act. That night, they donned their CyberSafe Guard suits and set out to confront CyberBully. With shields shimmering under the moonlight, they traced the source of the malicious messages back to CyberBully’s lair.<br>
                            Their battle was fierce. CyberBully’s attacks were swift, but Hero’s shield blocked every strike. Miko, with her agility, countered with powerful waves from her shield, pushing CyberBully back. Together, they managed to corner the villain, who, despite its strength, was no match for their determination to protect their children.</p>

                        <p class="lead fs-2">Returning home, Hero and Miko found Joe and Joana waiting anxiously. They had sensed their parents were not ordinary and now, they were ready to know the truth. With a deep breath, Hero and Miko revealed their secret identities, sharing the importance of standing up against digital threats and always staying safe online.<br>
                            Inspired by their parents, Joe and Joana vowed to help other children recognize and combat cyberbullying. They learned that with knowledge, kindness, and the courage to seek help, no child had to face bullies alone.</p>
